Project Nevada
==============

Planning Time! is the planning poker app designed and developed by Redbooth. Use it to make your sprint planning meetings even more fun! 

Learn the story behind these scrum cards (including the meaning of each card): [scrum-planning-poker-cards](https://redbooth.com/blog/scrum-planning-poker-cards)

But that’s not all! You can also print your own deck. Design is open sourced too and you can find it [here](https://github.com/redbooth/Scrum-poker-cards)
